# 🚀 **Migration to Railway Cron Service**

## **✅ What Changed**

Migrated from internal node-cron scheduler to Railway's built-in cron service for better reliability and resource management.

**Before:** Cron job ran inside your web service process  
**After:** Railway's dedicated cron service calls your API endpoint

---

## **📋 Migration Steps**

### **Step 1: Add Environment Variable in Railway**

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard** → Your Project → Variables
2. **Add new variable:**
   ```bash
   CRON_AUTH_TOKEN=your_super_secret_long_random_token_here_make_it_32_characters_min
   ```
3. **Generate a secure token** (e.g., `openssl rand -hex 32`)

### **Step 2: Deploy Updated Code**

The updated code includes:
- ✅ `railway.json` with cron configuration
- ✅ Updated API endpoint for Railway cron auth
- ✅ Disabled internal node-cron scheduler

**Deploy command:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Migrate to Railway cron service"  
git push origin main
```

### **Step 3: Verify Railway Cron Setup**

1. **Check Railway Dashboard** → Your Project → Cron
2. **Should see:** 
   - Schedule: `0 3 * * *` (daily at 3AM UTC)
   - Command: `curl -X POST https://...`
   - Status: Active

### **Step 4: Test the Setup**

**Manual test:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/cron/maintenance-entries \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Maintenance entry creation job executed successfully",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T20:00:00.000Z",
  "triggeredBy": "Railway cron service"
}
```

## **🔍 Verification Checklist**

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] **Railway cron shows up** in dashboard cron section
- [ ] **Environment variable** `CRON_AUTH_TOKEN` is set
- [ ] **Manual test** with cron token works
- [ ] **Server logs** show: `"⚠️ Internal scheduling disabled - using Railway cron service instead"`
- [ ] **No more node-cron logs** on server startup

---

## **🕐 Expected Behavior**

### **Daily at 8PM Pacific (3AM UTC)**
1. **Railway cron service** makes HTTP request to your API
2. **Your API endpoint** authenticates with `CRON_AUTH_TOKEN`
3. **CronService logic** runs (same as before)
4. **Results logged** in Railway logs

### **Server Startup Logs**
```bash
🚀 Server running on port 3000
⏰ Cron service available for Railway scheduling (no internal scheduler)
# No more: "✅ Daily Notion maintenance entry job scheduled..."
```

### **Railway Cron Execution Logs**
```bash
🧪 Maintenance entry creation triggered by: Railway cron service
📅 Starting to create maintenance entries for tomorrow
👥 Found helper assignments: ["Virginia"]
📋 Found 2 client visits for target day
✅ Successfully created Notion entry for Anne
📊 Completed: 🆕 Created: 1, 📝 Updated: 1, ❌ Errors: 0
```

---

## **🚨 Troubleshooting**

### **Railway Cron Not Showing**
- Check `railway.json` syntax is valid
- Redeploy if needed: Railway detects cron config on deployment

### **Authentication Errors**
```bash
401 Unauthorized - requires CRON_AUTH_TOKEN or user authentication
```
- Verify `CRON_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable is set
- Check token matches between Railway dashboard and cron command

### **Cron Job Fails**
- Check Railway logs for curl command errors
- Verify your app URL is accessible: `https://$RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`
- Test API endpoint manually first

### **Still Using Internal Scheduler**
If you see: `"✅ Daily Notion maintenance entry job scheduled..."`
- Make sure you deployed the updated code
- Internal scheduler should be disabled

## **🎯 Benefits of Railway Cron**

✅ **More reliable** - doesn't depend on web service uptime  
✅ **Better resource usage** - separate from web app  
✅ **Railway's infrastructure** handles scheduling  
✅ **Easier monitoring** - visible in Railway dashboard  
✅ **Scales independently** - cron doesn't affect web performance

## **📞 Support**

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Railway logs** for both web service and cron execution
2. **Test API endpoint manually** with curl
3. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
4. **Check Railway dashboard** cron section for job status

The migration keeps all existing functionality while making it more reliable! 🚀
