# Andrea's AI Scheduling Assistant - POC Product Requirements

## Problem Statement

Andrea runs a landscaping business with 3-4 part-time helpers and faces complex scheduling challenges. She currently manages her schedule in Google Calendar but struggles with:

- **Geographic optimization**: Grouping clients by location to minimize travel time
- **Helper management**: Ensuring each helper gets 7-8 hours on their designated days
- **Emergency scheduling**: Fitting in urgent work or covering for sick helpers
- **Constraint balancing**: Managing client preferences, helper capabilities, maintenance schedules, and travel efficiency simultaneously

The scheduling decisions require weighing multiple competing factors that are difficult to optimize manually, especially when disruptions occur.

## Vision

Create an AI-powered scheduling assistant that can read Andrea's current calendar and client database, then provide intelligent scheduling recommendations that optimize for travel efficiency, helper utilization, and client satisfaction.

## POC Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Validate that an LLM can effectively handle complex scheduling optimization with real-world constraints.

**Key Questions to Answer**:
1. Can Claude understand calendar context and make realistic scheduling suggestions?
2. How well does it balance geographic efficiency vs. other constraints?
3. Can it handle emergency scenarios ("fit in urgent work tomorrow")?
4. Does it respect helper capabilities and hour requirements?
5. What data inputs and prompt structures yield the best results?

## Success Criteria

- **Practical suggestions**: AI recommendations that Andrea would realistically follow
- **Constraint awareness**: Properly respects helper hours, travel limits, and client preferences  
- **Geographic intelligence**: Groups nearby clients and minimizes unnecessary travel
- **Emergency handling**: Can quickly suggest solutions for urgent scheduling needs
- **Explanation quality**: Provides clear reasoning for scheduling decisions
- **Collaborative**: Is able to work with the user and does not try to over-confidently solve everything if there are challenges.

## Core Functionality

### Data Integration
- **Google Calendar**: Read current schedule and events
- **Client Database**: (via google sheets) Access client information, maintenance schedules, preferences
- **Helper Database**: (via google sheets) Track availability, capabilities, hour requirements
- **Geographic Data**: Calculate travel times between client locations

### AI Scheduling Intelligence
- **Schedule Analysis**: Understand current week's commitments and constraints
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Recommend schedule improvements for efficiency
- **Emergency Planning**: Quickly reschedule when helpers are unavailable
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Balance multiple competing priorities intelligently

### User Interaction
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language scheduling discussions
- **Scenario Testing**: "What if" planning for different situations
- **Decision Support**: Clear explanations of scheduling trade-offs

## User Stories

### Primary Use Cases
- **As Andrea**, I want to ask "Where can I fit Client X's 4-hour maintenance visit next week?" and get intelligent suggestions based on helper availability and geographic efficiency
- **As Andrea**, I want to say "Sarah called in sick Tuesday" and get recommendations for rescheduling based on the reduced capacity
- **As Andrea**, I want the system to proactively identify scheduling inefficiencies and suggest improvements
- **As Andrea**, I want to understand why the AI made certain scheduling recommendations

### Secondary Use Cases  
- **As Andrea**, I want to plan around upcoming vacations by seeing how to redistribute regular maintenance
- **As Andrea**, I want to evaluate whether I can take on a new client without disrupting existing schedules
- **As Andrea**, I want to optimize my weekly schedule for minimal travel time
- **As Andrea**, I want to analyze my current workload

## Technical Approach

### Architecture
- **Web Application**: Simple interface for data management and AI interaction
- **API Integration**: Google Calendar, Google Sheets, Google Maps, Claude API
- **Data Sources**: Spreadsheet-based client/helper databases for flexibility to start

### Core Components
- **Calendar Reader**: Extract and structure schedule data
- **Geographic Engine**: Calculate travel times and optimize routing
- **AI Assistant**: Claude API integration with rich scheduling context
- **Chat Interface**: Conversational scheduling discussions

### Data Flow
1. Read current schedule from Google Calendar
2. Load client/helper data from Google Sheets  
3. Augment with geographic/travel information
4. Send structured data + user query + standard prompt to Claude
5. Present AI recommendations with reasoning

## Scope Limitations (POC)

**In Scope**:
- Basic scheduling optimization and recommendations
- Geographic travel time optimization
- Helper availability and capability matching
- Emergency rescheduling scenarios
- Conversational scheduling interface

**Out of Scope**:
- Automated calendar updates (AI suggests, human approves)
- Client communication/notifications
- Complex project management
- Financial tracking/invoicing
- Mobile interface
- Multi-user access

## Key Assumptions

- **Single user system**: Built specifically for Andrea's workflow
- **Manual approval**: AI suggests, Andrea decides and implements
- **Existing tools**: Integrates with current Google Calendar workflow
- **Data quality**: Client/helper information is reasonably accurate and current
- **Geographic focus**: Portland metro area with predictable travel patterns

## Success Metrics

### Qualitative
- **Usefulness**: Would Andrea actually use these recommendations?
- **Accuracy**: Do suggestions respect all stated constraints?
- **Practicality**: Are recommendations implementable in the real world?

### Quantitative  
- **Constraint compliance**: Appropriate respect for different constraints.
- **Scheduling time saved**: Significant reduction in the amount of time/stress for Andrea when it comes to scheduling work.
- **Response quality**: Clear reasoning provided for scheduling decisions


## Next Steps Post-POC

If successful, the POC would inform development of a production system with:
- **Handling of non-recurring work**: Support for emergent work and one-off projects
- **Handling of non-field work**: Support for office tasks (invoicing, design, scheduling, etc)
- **Automated calendar integration**: AI can create/modify events with approval
- **Proactive notifications**: Weekly optimization suggestions
- **Enhanced intelligence**: Learning from historical scheduling patterns
- **Expanded scope**: Project management and client communication features

## Definition of Done

The POC is complete when:
1. **Core functionality works**: Can read calendar, analyze constraints, provide scheduling suggestions
2. **Real-world testing**: Successfully handles Andrea's actual client data and scheduling scenarios
3. **Technical validation**: Demonstrates LLM scheduling capabilities and limitations  
4. **Decision framework**: Clear path forward for full system development
5. **User feedback**: Andrea's assessment of practical value and usability
